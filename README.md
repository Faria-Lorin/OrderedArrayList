# OrderedArrayList
Discussion Summary:

- You need to have access to that type in order to extend that type
- You can give it a default array and constructor for when it's empty
- There was some confusion about the default and the startingCapacity constructors
- When you call the NoNullArrayList, has to say if it's a null value or not before it calls ArrayList
- We were discussing how if there is no private instances, how do you change the data because there was some confusion about it.
- We also discussed when we would use super. And how we would override it
- if there is no null value, call super
